## Array Implementation over Linked List

Advantage:

-- size  : for every element we take one block of space. Whereas in LinkedList we take two block one for the data and other for the address
-- display -- o(1)

Disadvantage: 

-- size --> fixed --> overflow


LinkedList over Array 

Advantage: 

 size-->> unlimited

 Disadvantage: 

  size--> takes two blocks each element

  display in reverse which makes the space complexity o(N);
